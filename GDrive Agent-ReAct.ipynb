      "Summary: The prime minister of India (ISO: Bhārata kē Pradhānamantrī) is the head of government of the Republic of India. Executive authority is vested in the prime minister and his chosen Council of Ministers, despite the president of India being the nominal head of the executive.  The prime minister has to be a member of one of the houses of bicameral Parliament of India, alongside heading the respective house. The prime minister and the cabinet are at all times responsible to the Lok Sabha.\n",
      "The sitting prime minister ranks third in the Order of Precedence of India and is appointed by the president of India; however, the prime minister has to enjoy the confidence of the majority of Lok Sabha members, who are directly elected every five years, lest the prime minister shall resign. The prime minister can be a member of the Lok Sabha or the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the parliament. The prime minister controls the selection and dismissal of members of the Union Council of Ministers and allocation of posts to members within the government.\n",
      "The longest-serving prime minister was the first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, whose tenure lasted 16 years and 286 days. His premiership was followed by Lal Bahadur Shastri's short tenure and Indira Gandhi's 11- and 4-year-long tenures, with both politicians belonging to the Indian National Congress. After Indira Gandhi's assassination, her son Rajiv Gandhi took charge until 1989, when a decade with five unstable governments began. This was followed by the full terms of P. V. Narasimha Rao, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, Manmohan Singh, and Narendra Modi, who is the current prime minister of India, serving since 26 May 2014. He is the first non-Congress leader to win three consecutive general elections and secure a third successive term (2014, 2019, 2024). The first prime minister to do so was Jawaharlal Nehru, who won the general elections of 1952, 1957, and 1962.\n",

Although the president of India is the constitutional, nominal, and ceremonial head of state, in practice and ordinarily, the executive authority is vested in the prime minister and their chosen Council of Ministers. The prime minister is the leader elected by the party with a majority in the lower house of the Indian parliament, the Lok Sabha, which is the main legislative body in the Republic of India. The prime minister and their cabinet are at all times responsible to the Lok Sabha. The prime minister can be a member of the Lok Sabha or of the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the parliament.

The prime minister unilaterally controls the selection and dismissal of members of the council; and allocation of posts to members within the government.

      "The aviation industry operates within a highly regulated, \n",
      "safety-critical environment, relying extensively on complex \n",
      "software systems embedded in flight control, navigation, \n",
      "maintenance, and communication platforms. These systems \n",
      "must meet stringent standards for reliability, precision, and \n",
      "resilience under varying operational conditions. As aviation \n",
      "technology platforms evolve, they increasingly incorporate \n",
      "dynamic software architectures that require continuous \n",
      "updates, adaptation, and error mitigation [1, 2]. \n",
      "In response to growing software complexity, artificial \n",
      "intelligence has emerged as a transformative force in software \n",
      "engineering [3]. Machine learning algorithms, natural \n",
      "language processing, and intelligent automation are now \n",
      "being integrated into development and maintenance \n",
      "pipelines. This shift enables tools capable of code \n",
      "comprehension, automated debugging, and predictive \n",
      "maintenance, thereby optimizing the performance and \n",
      "reliability of critical systems [4, 5]. \n",
      "Among these developments, AI-augmented refactoring and \n",
      "code validation tools have gained prominence. In the context \n",
      "of aviation, their importance is amplified due to the necessity \n",
      "of rigorous code quality assurance. These tools not only \n",
      "reduce human error but also improve code maintainability, \n",
      "traceability, and compliance with established safety \n",

      "This review aims to systematically evaluate the current \n",

The study presents in-flight observations and model simulations to understand the role of volatile aerosol in contrail ice activation in the absence of soot. Key findings include a massive reduction in soot particle emissions with lean-burn engines, while volatile particle emissions and contrail ice crystal numbers remain high. The research highlights the need to minimize volatile particle emissions and consider fuel composition and engine design for cleaner aviation. The study also emphasizes the importance of incorporating these findings into climate models for reliable contrail climate effect predictions and future fleet simulations, including hydrogen-based technologies.\n",
